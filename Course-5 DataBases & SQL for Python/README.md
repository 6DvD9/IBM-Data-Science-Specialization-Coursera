# Databases and SQL for Data Science
## About this Course
Much of the world's data resides in databases. SQL (or Structured Query Language) is a powerful language which is used for communicating with and extracting data from databases. A working knowledge of databases and SQL is a must if you want to become a data scientist.

The purpose of this course is to introduce relational database concepts and help you learn and apply foundational knowledge of the SQL language. It is also intended to get you started with performing SQL access in a data science environment.  

The emphasis in this course is on hands-on and practical learning . As such, you will work with real databases, real data science tools, and real-world datasets. You will create a database instance in the cloud. Through a series of hands-on labs you will practice building and running SQL queries. You will also learn how to access databases from Jupyter notebooks using SQL and Python.

**This course is part of multiple programs**
> This course can be applied to multiple Specializations or Professional Certificates programs. Completing this course will count towards your learning in any of the following programs:
* IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
* Introduction to Data Science Specialization

## Course Syllabus
* **Week 1 - Introduction to Databases and Basic SQL**
> In Week 1 you will be introduced to databases. You will create a database instance on the cloud. You will learn some of the basic SQL statements. You will also write and practice basic SQL hands-on on a live database.

* **Week 2 - Advanced SQL**
> By the end of this module, you will learn the following: (1) Learn how to use string patterns and ranges to search data and how to sort and group data in result sets. (2) Learn how to work with multiple tables in a relational database using join operations.

* **Week 3 - Accessing Databases using Python** 
> After completing the lessons in this week, you will learn how to explain the basic concepts related to using Python to connect to databases and then create tables, load data, query data using SQL, and analyze data using Python

* **Week 4: Course Assignment**
As a hands-on Data Science assignment, you will be working with multiple real world datasets for the city of Chicago. You will be asked questions that will help you understand the data just like a data scientist would. You will be assessed both on the correctness of your SQL queries and results.
