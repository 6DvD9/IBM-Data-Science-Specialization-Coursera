# IBM-Data-Science-Specialization

# Machine Learning with Python
## About this Course
This course dives into the basics of machine learning using an approachable, and well-known programming language, Python. 

In this course, we will be reviewing two main components:
First, you will be learning about the purpose of Machine Learning and where it applies to the real world. 
Second, you will get a general overview of Machine Learning topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning,  model evaluation, and Machine Learning algorithms. 

In this course, you practice with real-life examples of Machine learning and see how it affects society in ways you may not have guessed!

By just putting in a few hours a week for the next few weeks, this is what youâ€™ll get.
1) New skills to add to your resume, such as regression, classification, clustering, sci-kit learn and SciPy 
2) New projects that you can add to your portfolio, including cancer detection, predicting economic trends, predicting customer churn, recommendation engines, and many more.
3) And a certificate in machine learning to prove your competency, and share it anywhere you like online or offline, such as LinkedIn profiles and social media.


**This course is part of multiple programs**
